### 1. Implementation of a Baseline Model ðŸ“ˆ

The previous notebook stopped after data preparation and scaling. The updated notebook implements a *Linear Regression model* as a baseline.

* It trains the model on the preprocessed data.
* It evaluates the model's performance using standard regression metrics:
    * *Mean Squared Error (MSE):* 2108.40
    * *Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):* 45.92
    * *R-squared ($R^2$):* 0.51
* The results are saved to a JSON file named linear_regression_evaluation_report.json.

### 2. Advanced Modeling with a Neural Network ðŸ§ 

The most significant improvement is the introduction of a more sophisticated model using *TensorFlow and Keras*. This moves beyond simple linear models to capture more complex patterns in the data.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning for Optimization âš™

Instead of using a fixed architecture, the new notebook employs *KerasTuner* with RandomSearch to automatically find the best hyperparameters for the neural network. This optimization process systematically tested different combinations of:
* *Neurons in the first hidden layer:* Tuned between 32 and 128.
* *Neurons in the second hidden layer:* Tuned between 16 and 64.
* *Learning rate:* Tuned among choices of 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001.

The best parameters found were:
* *First Layer Units:* 80
* *Second Layer Units:* 32
* *Learning Rate:* 0.001

### 4. Final Model Training and Performance Comparison ðŸ“Š

After identifying the optimal hyperparameters, a final neural network model was built and trained. The notebook concludes with a direct comparison between the baseline and the advanced model, clearly demonstrating the value of the improvements.

* *Simple Linear Regression $R^2$:* 0.51
* *Fine-Tuned Neural Network $R^2$:* *0.75*

This shows a *significant increase in predictive accuracy*, with the fine-tuned neural network explaining 75% of the variance in the target variable (PM2.5) compared to only 51% for the linear regression model.
